### PUPRemote ###

Use this library to communicate as a Powered UP (PUP) Device with LEGO smart hubs. It has a basic PUPDeviceEmulator and a higher-level PUPRemote library that acts more like RPC (Remote Procedure Calling).

## Status

The library is untested, and PUPDeviceEmulator is in development.

## TODO
- Add mode dicts and type id's for common sensors.
- Design high-level api
